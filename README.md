# Jett-Pesson_Public-Repo
This repo is just a little piece of my brain on the public repo so I can be apart of the archive program.
I'm going to just fill it with helpful information and queries that I have assembled over the years. A majority will be helpful Oracle queries/scripts/functions since I've been mostly developing in Oracle for the last 6 years.
